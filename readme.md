# Ford GoBike System Dateset
## by Fahad AlQahtani 

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset.

## Ford GoBike System Dateset


There are 718,994 data trips for fordgobike in the dataset with 18 features (trip_duration, start_time, stop_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude ,end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type,birth_year,gender). I've added some columns to help me investigate my data easier (User_age,start_time_hour,stop_time_hour). The data types are category(3), datetime64 ns(2), float64(5), int64(4), object(4).

## Summary of Findings

Trip Duration dosen't has a clear relationship with the age of the member But for the people on age 51 there is a kind of relationship however, Other has highest median of trip duration and female has higher median then Male .Although the max for other and female higher than the male however number of male riders are very high then other and female on the dataset.
Also, there is no clear relationship between the start and stop time and trip duration.
Aslo, higher percentage of customer rides longer trips then subscriber.finaly, the old people tend to start their trip on early time but young people use the bike in late night


## Key Insights for Presentation

The 51 old age riders can ride for 140 Minutes.
most of people use the bike from 17:00 to 18:00 
there is an accumulation of data for both males and females between 0 to 40 minutes while the other has the highest trip duration for aged 51.
subscriber has higher tripe duration on all the ages more than the customer.
